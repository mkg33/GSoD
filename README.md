# SciPy project (Google Season of Docs)

Check out the current SciPy [user survey](https://forms.gle/vz4Hp8ayjLyYYgUL7) and tell us how we could improve the documentation.

Work in progress.

This repository contains the suggested graphical guides to be included in the SciPy documentation. The premise of the guides is to facilitate the navigation and exploration of the documentation. All comments welcome.  

* I intend to use the typographical and graphical conventions presented in the file called 'hierarchy.tex'
* the linear algebra file ('sample_guide.tex') was the first prototype for this project and the code is still a bit messy
* the SciPy official colour scheme was used in the two guides - this is sill subject to change; i.e., accessibility issues, saturation, etc.
* the three screenshots present different colour saturation - if you wish, you can compare them and express your opinion
* I also have several other prototypes but they look pretty much the same as 'hierarchy.tex', so I won't be posting them for now

Additional details:

* the motivation behind breaking the line and placing the ampersand at the beginning of the line is given, e.g., [here](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/15783/is-ampersand-allowed-at-the-beginning-of-line)
* see also this related [issue](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/10875)

Here is a sample guide:
