SciPy project (Google Season of Docs)

This repository contains the suggested graphical guides to be included in the SciPy documentation. The premise of the guides is to facilitate the navigation and exploration of the documentation. All comments welcome.  


* I intend to use the typographical & graphical conventions presented in the file called 'hierarchy.tex'
* the linear algebra file ('sample_guide.tex') was the first prototype for this project and the code is still a bit messy
* the SciPy official colour scheme was used in the two guides - this is sill subject to change; i.e., accessibility issues, saturation, etc.
* the three screenshots present different colour saturation - if you wish, you can compare them and express your opinion
* I also have several other prototypes but they look pretty much the same as 'hierarchy.tex', so I won't be posting them for now
